# Life Expentancy Prediction Machine Learning Project
Using machine learning algorithms to predict life expectancy using dataset with vaious of features surrounding health factors and sociopolitical factors.

### Cloning and Running the Project
This project requires installation of Anaconda or MiniConda in your PC to enable initialisation of its Conda environments (there is an `environment.yaml` file containing details of all dependencies in the prpoject folder.).   
Once you have Anaconda or MiniConda installed in your PC follow the steps below to install all dependencies and run the code in the notebook with Jupyter Notebook.  

### Installing all Dependencies in the Conda Environment  
1. Clone this GIT repository into your local machine.
2. Launch Anaconda Prompt (on Windows PC) or Terminal (on Mac) and navigate to the cloned project's folder path. 
3. Run the command below in Anaconda Prompt or Teminal to automatically install the dependencies.  
  `conda env create --file environment.yaml --name env`
4. Once all dependencies are done installing, you can activate the environment using the command below (this allows you make use of the environment's tools and libraries like Jupyter).  
  `conda activate ./env`
5. To launch Jupyter run the command below.  
   `jupyter notebook`
6. From Jupyter you can open the "__Life_Expectancy_prediction_ML.ipynb__" notebook and run the code.
