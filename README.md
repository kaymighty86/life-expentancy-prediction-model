# Life Expentancy Prediction Machine Learning Project
Desinging a machine learning model that is able to predict life expectancy using dataset with vaious of features surrounding health factors and sociopolitical factors.

### Cloning and Running the Project
This project requires installation of Anaconda or MiniConda to enable initialisation of its Conda environments (there is an `environment.yaml` file containing details of all dependencies in the prpoject folder.).   
Once you have Anaconda or MiniConda Installed follow the steps below to initialise the environment by installing all dependencies and running the notebook with Jupyter Notebook.  

### Installing all Dependencies in the Conda Environment  
1. Clone the repository into your local machine
2. Launch Anaconda Prompt or Terminal and navigate to the project path 
3. Run the command below in Anaconda Prompt or Teminal to automatically install the dependencies  
  `conda env create --file environment.yaml --name env`
4. Once all dependencies are done installing, you can activate the environment using the command below (this allows you make use of the environment's tools and libraries like Jupyter)  
  `conda activate ./env`
5. To launch Jupyter run the command below  
   `jupyter notebook`
6. From Jupyter you can open the "__Life_Expectancy_prediction_ML.ipynb__" notebook and run the code
